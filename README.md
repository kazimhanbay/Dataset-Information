# Dataset-Information

This dataset contains satellite images processed into 800x800 pixel segments. The dataset includes images of ships and sea, verified by SAR experts. The dataset aims to aid in the development and evaluation of ship detection algorithms using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery.

## Dataset Description Version 1

The first version of the dataset is divided into two main categories:

1. **Ship**: Contains images with various types of ships and includes 10,000 images.
2. **Sea**: Contains images of the sea without ships and includes 10,000 images.

## Dataset Description Version 2

The second version of dataset has been processed using real-esrgan and contains categories such as land/ship/sea and ship.

The second version of the dataset is divided into two main categories:

1. **Ship**: Contains images with various types of ships.
2. **Sea/Ship/Land**: Contains images of the mix(sea,ship,land).

Note:The two categories consist of a total of 10,000 images.
